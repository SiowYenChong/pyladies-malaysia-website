## üöÄ Quick Start (Local Development)

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project running for development.

### Prerequisites

You must have Python (3.9+) and pip installed.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/PyLadies-MY/pyladies-my-website.git](https://github.com/PyLadies-MY/pyladies-my-website.git)
    cd pyladies-my-website
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    The project uses AWS S3 for static files and content. For local development, you need a placeholder `.env` file.

    **Create a file named `.env` in the root directory:**
    ```env
    # Essential Django Settings
    SECRET_KEY='django-insecure-your-secret-key-for-local'
    DEBUG=True
    
    # Optional: Mock S3 Credentials for Boto3 (Only needed if local file listing fails)
    # AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AKIA...'
    # AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='...'
    
    # Set AWS_LOCATION to match your settings.py if using S3 locally
    AWS_LOCATION='theme/static' 
    
    # Use the local filesystem for static files by default (DEBUG=True)
    # If using custom S3 logic, ensure you have read access.
    ```

5.  **Run Migrations (if needed) & Server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations 
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The site should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
