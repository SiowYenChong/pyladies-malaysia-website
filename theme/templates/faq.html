                        No, PyLadies is not a training company or a business. We are a volunteer-run organization and our events are based on the generosity of our members who share their knowledge and passion for Python. Our focus is on community building, not profit.

                        The tech industry has a very low representation of women. PyLadies was created to provide a comfortable and welcoming space for women to learn and share without feeling intimidated. By creating a women-focused environment, we aim to encourage more women to join and excel in the tech field.
